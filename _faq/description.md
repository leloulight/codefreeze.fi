That's what I wear. Mostly merino wool. Except of some inner layer mesh clothes and the outermost layer, which has to be windproof. Easy, isn't it. I wear using the same principles year around, if hiking / cycling in non-summer temperatures -> I wear merino wool 1-N layers with wind proof (or GoreTex) outer layer. Easy. 

For codefreeze, for you - what to bring. No need to buy everything. If you want something - think about buying something made from 100% merino wool - that I think would provide the most value and that could be used later.
Buff. again - my favorite garment of all: merino wool Buff. It made of awesomeness, in it's pure form. It has to be.

Anyway, I'll bring most of my gear. I'll be around from Sunday evening until Thursday (early) morning. I will be helping with the outer layer - so that no-one actually needs to freeze. 

And, if you'be read this far - please bring swimming suit. I know, we are in Finland and in Finland we go to sauna naked. That's true, except in (most) public saunas, where there can be anyone. And, swimming suit is nice when dipping into the rather refreshing water nearby the sauna.


 _#proTip_: To acclimatize ourselves (I do this too, and I've experienced the benefits already) - when we're taking a shower, let's turn the knob to the coldest and enjoy a really refreshing cold shower. For a few seconds (at start) and then few tens of seconds. Doing that, and freezing cold temperatures in Lapland don't feel that cold anymore.
