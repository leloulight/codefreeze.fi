Others then? 

Hats? [Merino wool Buff](http://www.buffwear.com/buff-adult-headwear/wool-buff) - don't hesitate. But two of those. Or three. That way, you can have a very warm hat (2 Buffs) and one very warm neckwarmer. Or bring normal hat, under which you can have a Buff hat.

I have 2 merino wool Buffs always with me. And some other hats, some are windproof, most are not.

Gloves?
I have, surprise again, merino wool inner gloves with warm outer gloves. Actually I have so many different kinds of gloves I can't even count. When doing anything physical, I wear very thinly gloves. Other times I wear the most warm I find. For you - bring at least some gloves. 

Socks?
Could you guess? I wear only merino wool socks. Nothing else. Matters.
