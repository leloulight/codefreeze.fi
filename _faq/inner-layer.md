For me, clothing always starts from the innermost layer. For me, it is the most important, that this particular layer insulates well and does not get/feel wet.
Merino wool underwear is my choice - nowadays I typically wear 100% merino wool from [smartwool](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/tekniset-alusasut/lightweight-bottom/)

If it is cold, say more than -10, I typically wear [strechmesh underpants](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/tekniset-alusasut/stretchmesh-pants/) that insulate too rather well. On top of that, I might have some extra middle-wear, but only if I am not going to do any physical exercise. Or if it really cold. With this setup (of inner layers), I've been skiing in -25C easily.

Similarly I wear on my body - [merino wool t-shirt](http://www.smartwool.com/clothing/baselayers/mens-nts-micro-150-tee.html), another layer of [merino wool](http://www.smartwool.com/clothing/baselayers/mens-nts-mid-250-crew-1.html), with some [mesh shirts](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/tekniset-alusasut/stretchmesh-tee-shirt/). Typically I wear, like this. 2-3 layers of very thin merino wool / mesh shirts. On very cold days, I might add one more merino wool shirt.
