Middle layer is something I typically wear only when I'm not doing anything physical. Or, when in codefreeze, probably all the time. Especially in the [Stars and the Moon night trek](http://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/outdoor-activities/weekly-program.html) - it's not going to be much of an exericse - cold it might be.

In middle layer I wear, for the biggest suprise, either more merino wool, or something totally different, either something made of [PolarTec](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/naisten-vaatteet/naisten-valiasut/womens-flux-power-stretch-jacket/) or [Fleece](http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/miesten-vaatteet/valiasut/isogon-hood/).
