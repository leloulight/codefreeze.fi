The Sauna World of Kiilopää is called Kuurakaltio. There are two electric saunas with dressing rooms and showers, as well as a traditional Finnish smoke sauna. There are separate sauna facilities for men and women.

After sauna, dip into the refreshing waters of Kiilopuro fell brook! In wintertime the water temperature is approx.  -1 ºC

During Codefreeze, 
the smoke sauna is heated on Tuesday on Wednesday, and on Tuesday we have a private sauna from 3pm-6pm.
